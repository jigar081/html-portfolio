<p><h2>Here's a short poem on Jigar:<br></h2>

  Jigar, oh Jigar,<br>
  Your name means heart,<br>
  And in that word,<br>
  There lies your art.<br>
  
  For you have courage,<br>
  And strength within,<br>
  And a passion that burns<br>
  Beneath your skin.<br>
  
  You face the world<br>
  With a steadfast will,<br>
  And through the trials<br>
  You rise still.<br>
  
  Jigar, oh Jigar,
  Your name does define<br>
  A person of heart,<br>
  A soul so fine.<br>
  </p>

<p><h3>Something</h3>
Jigar ke haath ne har mushkil ko hara diya,<br>
Jigar ka jazba ne dil mein umang bhar diya,<br>
Jigar ke iraade ne unchaiyon ko chhua,<br>
Jigar ki mehnat ne aasmaan ko chhua.<br></p>
